Overview of the augmentation system:

We have a design goal that aims at allowing:
    (1) Arbitrary structures of input data (e.g. list[list[boxes]], dict[str, boxes],
        multiple semantic segmentations for each image, etc) and arbitrary new data types
        (rotated boxes, 3D meshes, densepose, etc)
    (2) A list of augmentation to be applied sequentially

`Augmentation` defines policies to create a `Transform` object from input data by
`get_transform` method.
A `Transform` object usually describes deterministic transformation, in the sense that it can
be re-applied on associated data, e.g. the geometry of an image and its segmentation masks need
to be transformed in the same way, instead of both being randomly augmented in inconsistent ways.
(If you're sure such re-application is not needed, then determinism is not a crucial requirement.)
An augmentation policy may need to access arbitrary input data to create a `Transform`, so it
declares the needed input data by its `input_args` attribute. Users are expected to provide them
when calling its `get_transform` method.

`Augmentation` is not able to apply transforms to data: data associated with one sample may be
much more than what `Augmentation` gets. For example, >90% of the common augmentation policies
only need an image, but the actual input samples can be much more complicated.

`AugInput` manages all inputs needed by `Augmentation` and implements the logic
to apply a sequence of augmentation. It defines how the inputs should be modified by a `Transform`,
because inputs needed by one `Augmentation` needs to be transformed to become arguments of the
next `Augmentation` in the sequence.

`AugInput` does not need to contain all input data, because most augmentation policies
only need very few fields (e.g., >90% only need "image"). We provide `StandardAugInput`
that only contains "images", "boxes", "sem_seg", that are enough to create transforms
for most cases. In this way, users keep the responsibility and flexibility to apply transforms
to other (potentially new) data types and structures, e.g. keypoints, proposals boxes.

To extend the system, one can do:
1. To add a new augmentation policy that only needs to use standard inputs
   ("image", "boxes", "sem_seg"), writing a subclass of `Augmentation` is sufficient.
2. To use new data types or custom data structures, `StandardAugInput` can still be used as long
   as the new data types or custom data structures are not needed by any augmentation policy.
   The new data types or data structures can be transformed using the
   transforms returned by `AugInput.apply_augmentations`.
   The way new data types are transformed may need to declared using `Transform.register_type`.
3. (rare) To add new augmentation policies that need new data types or data structures, in
   addition to implementing new `Augmentation`, a new `AugInput` is needed as well.

    Augmentation defines policies/strategies to generate :class:`Transform` from data.
    It is often used for pre-processing of input data. A policy typically contains
    randomness, but it can also choose to deterministically generate a :class:`Transform`.

    A "policy" that generates a :class:`Transform` may, in the most general case,
    need arbitrary information from input data in order to determine what transforms
    to apply. Therefore, each :class:`Augmentation` instance defines the arguments
    needed by its :meth:`get_transform` method with the :attr:`input_args` attribute.
    When called with the positional arguments defined by the :attr:`input_args`,
    the :meth:`get_transform` method executes the policy.

    Examples:
    ::
        # if a policy needs to know both image and semantic segmentation
        assert aug.input_args == ("image", "sem_seg")
        tfm: Transform = aug.get_transform(image, sem_seg)
        new_image = tfm.apply_image(image)

    To implement a custom :class:`Augmentation`, define its :attr:`input_args` and
    implement :meth:`get_transform`.

    Note that :class:`Augmentation` defines the policies to create a :class:`Transform`,
    but not how to apply the actual transform to those data.
    """

    input_args: Tuple[str] = ("image",)
    """
    Attribute of class instances that defines the argument(s) needed by
    :meth:`get_transform`. Default to only "image", because most policies only
    require knowing the image in order to determine the transform.

    Users can freely define arbitrary new args and their types in custom
    :class:`Augmentation`. In detectron2 we use the following convention:

    * image: (H,W) or (H,W,C) ndarray of type uint8 in range [0, 255], or
      floating point in range [0, 1] or [0, 255].
    * boxes: (N,4) ndarray of float32. It represents the instance bounding boxes
      of N instances. Each is in XYXY format in unit of absolute coordinates.
    * sem_seg: (H,W) ndarray of type uint8. Each element is an integer label of pixel.

    We do not specify convention for other types and do not include builtin
    :class:`Augmentation` that uses other types in detectron2.
