Changelog for package robot_upstart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.3.3 (2021-05-12)
------------------
* Enable customization of  After= in service (`#104 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/104>`_)
  * Cosmetic
  Remove unnecessary parenthesis.
  * Correct typo
  * FIX: Remove unreachable code
  * Enable customizable After= in service
  This feature enables the user to define the services after which the
  generated service will. This is handy when hardware-related system
  services have to start before the ROS software.
* Added util-linux as dependency for setpriv.
* Bumped CMake version to avoid author warning.
* Contributors: Tkostas, Tony Baltovski

0.3.2 (2021-03-01)
------------------
* Using setpriv (`#101 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/101>`_)
  * Try replacing setuidgid with setpriv to see if this is a viable solution to the group permission issues
  * Fix a typo
  * Set the real and effective user and group IDs, not just the real ones
  * Add a missing "roslaunch" argument to the actual launch. Whoops :/
* Contributors: Chris I-B

0.3.1 (2021-03-01)
------------------
* [doc] Add commands when systemd is chosen. (`#78 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/78>`_)
  When `systemd` is specified as a provider, commands are different.
  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers
  [doc] Add systemd start/stop commands.
* Melodic compatibility: modify getifip for bionic output (`#88 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/88>`_)
  * Add net-tools as dependency because ifconfig is used
  * Modify getifip to handle bionic ifconfig output
* Break line that the linter doesn't like. (`#87 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/87>`_)
* [doc] Clarify the logic for automated job name determination. (`#82 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/82>`_)
  Problem addressed
  =================
  When `--job` option is not passed to `rosrun robot_upstart install`, the job name gets determined automatically but the logic of it is not clear.
  Solution to the problem
  =======================
  Add an explanation to the document.
* [CI][kinetic-devel] Update to Xenial. (`#79 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/79>`_)
  * [CI][kinetic-devel] Update to Xenial.
  On a PR https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/pull/78 I saw [CI failure](https://travis-ci.org/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/builds/507510733?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification) that seems to be related to platform issue. Using `trusty` for xenial-based job might not work (any more?).

0.2.0 (2015-03-14)
------------------
* Linter fixes.
* Contributors: Mike Purvis

0.1.2 (2015-03-13)
------------------
* Add some basic install/uninstall tests.
* Add uninstall job method and script.
* Remove out of date README content, now forwards to ROS Wiki and generated documentation.
* Add a documentation section about permissions
* Contributors: GaÃ«l Ecorchard, Mike Purvis

0.1.1 (2015-01-20)
------------------
* Python Rewrite
* The startup event is too early for ROS to start, use local-filesystems instead.
* Remove bash versions of the install and uninstall utilities.
* Add support for supplying the --wait flag to roslaunch.
* Add Sphinx documentation.
  To get the argparse docs required moving most of the install
  script to a module, which probably should have been done anyway.
* Add a new-implementation install script, refactor Provider to be a class rather than function.
* Add roslint.
* Initial implementation of Python job generator.
* Port templated files to use empy.
  This gets rid of the bespoke templating system that was so bad. Also
  notable here is adding a --root flag to install somewhere other than
  the actual root. This needs to be further fleshed out, for example
  by not reinvoking with sudo when installing to non-root location.
* use LANG=C for ifconfig
* add argument to specify log directory
* Contributors: Eisoku Kuroiwa, Mike Purvis, ipa-mig
